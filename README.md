Pocket Go Key Combination
===

I made this for my own use, if you want to use it go ahead. 
Not complete, you gotta make it ~~start on boot or something not 100% sure~~. Yes, you have to make it start on boot. Compile it and put it in some folder. Then edit `/etc/main` (it's a bash file) and make it start before the while loop.

### IMPORTANT - NOT TESTED
I have not tested this as my device hasen't arrived yet.
