Pocket Go Key Combination
===

I made this for my own use, if you want to use it go ahead. 
Not complete, you gotta make it ~~start on boot or something not 100% sure~~. Yes, you have to make it start on boot. Compile it and put it in some folder. Then edit `/etc/main` (it's a bash file) and make it start before the while loop.

The code is **UP RIGHT LEFT DOWN** by default, there is no way to change it except editing the code but that is quite easy to do, the trick is compiling... Ask some dudes [here](https://discord.gg/WkYGcVQ) for help with that.

### IMPORTANT - NOT TESTED
I have not tested this as my device hasen't arrived yet.
